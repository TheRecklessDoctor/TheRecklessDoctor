**` Software Engineer and Data Scientist `**

I am a final year computer science student in Monash University Malaysia, majoring in Data Science with a passion for integrating AI applications and techniques with conventional software engineering. I am self-taught in web development and currently exploring mobile application development in Swift and am working on Deep Learning and NLP through my degree. All projects are built after a bit of research and design in order to get a feel of the current space and the project but no extensive documentation process is done prior to development as an agile methodology is used in order to facilitate unexpected changes and allow for increased flexibility. I am open to all things tech and enjoy reading and learning new areas of technology. I maintain a medium page which I use to publish articles that directly correlate to what I am learning at any given time.
